# Project Schafkopf bot

Goals of this project are to develop an A.I. for real-time recognition of the 32 cards of the card game Schafkopf (cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schafkopf).
Further it which of the 4 players played a card.

In a second step a recommendation shall be given dependent on the best winning probabilities. 

A Rhasperry Pi via cam module shall record, film and send the images via kafka to a stronger cpu for recognition in real-time. 

The project is based on the amazing work from
